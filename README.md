   <p2>The Man wants to hold you down, don't let him. Rise up and fight those who try
to oppress us. The first rule of the Academy is free thought. Now matter how dirty,
subversive, offensive, or wrong those thoughts may be. The second rule of the Academy is
you must always be informed, we never stop learning at the Academy. Third rule of the 
Academy is Stay Positive. It's a bleek, sad, disgusting world out there. To keep it from
getting you down, the belief that it could get better will make your days at the Academy
a wonderful time. The fourth rule of the Academy is Unity, we are a family that is diverse 
and strong, it's important that we have each other's sixes in these crazy times. We must 
help each other out when someone needs it</p2>
